	<ul>
		<li><strong>1901</strong> - he was born in the area of Nowogródczyzna, Poland.</li>
		<li><strong>1910</strong> - his mother Ludwika and his brothers and sisters moved to Vilnus, where he joined the secret ZHP Scouts organization.</li>
		<li><strong>1918</strong> - during World War I, Pilecki joined Polish self-defense units in the Wilno area with which he helped collect weapons and disarm retreating German troops in what became the prelude to the Vilna offensive. </li>
		<li><strong>1919 - 1920</strong> - during the Polish-Soviet War, Pilecki commanded a ZHP Scout section that was overrun by the Bolsheviks. He later joined the regular Polish Army and fought in the Polish retreat from Kiev.</li>

    	<li><strong>1940</strong> - during World War II, Pilecki smuggled himself into Auschwitz under the false name Tomasz Serafinski and began recruiting members for an underground resistance group that he organized into a coherent movement. He began sending information about what was going on inside the camp and confirming that the Nazis were seeking the extermination of the Jews to Britain and the United States as early as 1941. Pilecki used a courier system that the Polish Resistance operated throughout occupied Europe to channel the reports to the Allies.</li>
    	<li><strong>1942</strong> - Pilecki's resistance group had learned of the existence of the gas chambers and began work on several plans to liberate Auschwitz, including one in which the RAF would bomb the walls or Free Polish paratroopers would fly in from Britain.</li>
